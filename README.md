# SWG-Mods
Collection of SWG mods that I have made. These are all for NGE version.

## Silent Crafting Stations Mod
* does exactly what the name implies

## No Squint Mod (v5 release 3/30/2018) (Legends stub added 3/29/2018)
![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) **Note: This mod is not compatible with ILM, or other font mods that increase size, please remove/disable those when using this one.**

The main mod file is based on the last official patch from SOE in the leaked code. Since all servers have their own way of updating game files the main mod might not be enough, thus a server specific stub may be needed.


* This mod resizes elements / increases font sizes for <b>1920x1080</b> screens (I do not have a 4k screen or I would make a separate version for those sizes).
* Entertainer image designer has been redone so that the color palletes are easier to see.
* Crafting windows tweaked for readability and also color pallettes.
* Mail, various lists and dialogues.
* Lots of HUD elements resized to accomodate font increases including both ground and space.
* There's actually just too much to list here. Try it out, if you don't like it you can always delete.
* (more updates will be coming as I have not gotten to everything yet, check back for updates)

<b>Note: As of v3, this mod resizes the main game menu (ground). To avoid it going offscreen and having to do a /ui hudreset... before you apply this mod, go ingame and move that game menu (the little silver button) toward the center of screen on ALL toons. After the mod has been applied you can then place it back wherever you want. If you had v3 (or higher) in the past and are just upgrading there should be no need to do this.</b>


v5 contains a new ground chatbox that is deskinned. It borrows elements from the space chatbox. This was done to facilitate making the static elements in it bigger to accomodate larger fonts. If you would prefer the old chatbox back but still use this mod simply delete the ui_ground_hud_chat_window_skinned.inc in the SWG  ui folder.

For those that ask about chat bubbles and game objects, there are sliders for both in the in game options. Chat Bubbles:  **Options -> Chat -> Chat Bubble Font Size (slider)** and for game objects in spacial: **Options -> Misc -> Object Name Font Size (slider)**
